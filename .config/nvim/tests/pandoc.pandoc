well, [the example.com website](http://www.example.com) 

testing footnotes[^footnote1]. this is kinda silly.^[another footnote.] 
^superscrips^ are ok, but be careful to keep spaces between the inline
footnotes and the superscripts.^[inline footnotes-- *test*]

[^footnote1]: this is a footnote --.

What follows are some notes on algorithms I've been reviewing from
[Algorithms](http://amzn.com/032157351X) by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne,
[The Algorithm Design Manual](http://amzn.com/1849967202) by Steven S. Skiena,
and other sources around the Internet [^mit] [^umd] [^umgd]. I wanted to write
some notes on the material so that I could easily look back on it, but mainly so
that I could be sure that I understand the material --- since I have to understand it
to explain it.

[Convolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution) is a mathematical method of combining two signals to form a third signal. fds sfddswhty is thie snot breaking? wht is your problem fdsa fdsa fds, fdsaf dsdf . fdsa

Passing the [Dirac delta
function](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_delta_function) (unit impulse)
$\delta[n]$ through a linear system results in the impulse response $h[n]$. The
impulse response is simply the signal resulting from passing the unit impulse
(Dirac delta function) through a linear system. fdsa fdsa fdsa fdsa fdsa fdsa
